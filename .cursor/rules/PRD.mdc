# AI-Powered Search Engine for LLMs - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
### **Product Name:** TBD (e.g., "AI-First Search" or "LLM Search Hub")
### **Author:** [Your Name]
### **Last Updated:** [Date]
### **Status:** Draft

### **Background & Motivation**
Traditional search engines are designed for humans, returning ranked links based on text content. However, LLMs (large language models) require structured, real-time, and API-accessible data to deliver high-quality responses. Existing solutions like Google Search and Perplexity AI rely on traditional web search and are inadequate for structured information retrieval, on-chain data, and third-party APIs.

This PRD outlines a **Google for AI**—a search engine built **for LLMs, not humans**. The goal is to create a **structured, API-first, and vector-based search engine** that serves LLMs and AI agents, prioritizing **structured data, open API integrations, and real-time information access.**

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### **Primary Goals:**
1. **LLM-Optimized Search** – Provide LLMs with structured data instead of plain text pages.
2. **Data Marketplace for AI Agents** – Enable third-party data providers to contribute structured datasets and get paid based on query usage.
3. **Hybrid Retrieval System** – Combine vector search (semantic) with structured database queries for accuracy and efficiency.
4. **Real-Time Data Integration** – Provide up-to-date financial, crypto, and market data via API-based ingestion.
5. **API-First Design** – Built as a **machine-consumable search engine**, accessible via API for AI applications.

### **Key Use Cases:**
- AI-powered **financial analysis** (real-time stock/crypto data, earnings reports, sentiment analysis)
- AI-driven **research assistants** (legal, academic, enterprise knowledge search)
- AI agents executing **autonomous tasks** (e.g., an AI assistant retrieving financial reports for an investment strategy)

---

## 3. Features & Requirements

### **3.1 Core Search Capabilities**
- ✅ **Vector-Based Semantic Search** (retrieve relevant documents based on meaning, not just keywords)
- ✅ **Structured Query Support** (SQL-based retrieval for financial and crypto datasets)
- ✅ **Multi-Source Integration** (aggregate results from APIs, databases, and real-time feeds)
- ✅ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** (improve LLM responses by grounding them in trusted sources)

### **3.2 Data Sources & Indexing**
- **Financial Data APIs** (stock prices, earnings reports, economic indicators)
- **Crypto On-Chain Data** (real-time blockchain analytics, whale movements, DeFi activity)
- **News & Market Sentiment** (financial news aggregators, social sentiment analysis)
- **Enterprise & Internal Data** (support for private indexes and enterprise knowledge bases)

### **3.3 Open Data Contribution & Monetization**
- **Data Provider Marketplace** – Allow third parties to provide structured data sources (e.g., premium stock market insights, on-chain analytics, etc.)
- **Query-Based Monetization** – Pay data providers per query hit, incentivizing high-quality data sources
- **AI Search API Subscriptions** – Monetize via tiered API access (freemium for basic queries, paid for high-volume or premium data)

### **3.4 User & AI Interaction Modes**
- **AI-Only API Access** – Search results are formatted for LLMs (JSON output with structured metadata)
- **Human-Readable Mode** – Simple web UI for developers to test queries and review data
- **AI Agent Integration** – Allow LLM-powered agents to use search autonomously (e.g., an investment AI retrieving and analyzing stock data)

## 4. Technical Requirements

### **4.1 Architecture**
- **Hybrid Search Engine** (Vector DB + SQL for structured queries)
- **OpenAPI for AI Access** (RESTful and GraphQL endpoints for structured data retrieval)
- **Serverless & Scalable Backend** (Cloud-based, scalable indexing & retrieval pipeline)
- **Fine-Tuned LLMs for Search Ranking** (Re-rank results based on AI model optimization)

### **4.2 AI Model Integration**
- Support for **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to enhance AI search responses
- Fine-tuned models for **domain-specific queries** (finance, legal, academic, etc.)
- Option for **local/private model hosting** (for enterprise security requirements)

### **4.3 Data Compliance & Security**
- **Access Control for Sensitive Data** (e.g., authentication for private datasets)
- **GDPR & Compliance-Ready** (Data security policies for enterprise customers)
- **Anti-Hallucination Mechanisms** (Ensure AI-generated responses are verifiable)

## 5. Monetization & Business Model

### **5.1 Revenue Streams**
1. **Subscription-Based API Access** – Paid plans for enterprises & developers
2. **Per-Query Pricing for Premium Data** – Charge micro-payments for access to specialized datasets
3. **Data Provider Revenue Sharing** – Allow third-party data providers to earn based on API usage
4. **Enterprise Custom Solutions** – Private deployments & fine-tuned AI search engines

### **5.2 Competitive Advantage**
- **Not Just a Search Engine** – AI-first, **structured data for LLMs**, unlike Perplexity AI or Google
- **Real-Time Market Data** – Unlike static search indexes, supports **live financial & crypto data**
- **Open Contribution Model** – Incentivize **data providers** to enrich the platform

## 6. Competitive Landscape

### **6.1 Existing AI Search Players**
| Competitor       | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Google Search   | Largest index, best general search | Not AI-optimized, paywalled content issues |
| Perplexity AI   | AI-enhanced search with citations | Still reliant on web crawling, lacks structured data API |
| BloombergGPT   | Finance-specific AI model | Expensive, closed ecosystem |
| Neeva AI       | AI-powered consumer search | Shut down, business model failed |

### **6.2 Why We Win**
- **Specialized, Structured Search for LLMs** – Unlike Perplexity & OpenAI’s web browsing
- **Real-Time Financial & Crypto Data** – Unlike Google or static web search
- **Marketplace Model** – Incentivizing data providers (unlike closed systems like Bloomberg)
- **API-First** – Designed for AI Agents, not human browsing
